Lightning round:
2014.07.25. 14:00 - 2014.07.26. 14:00 (24 hours)
Total time:
2014.07.25. 14:00 - 2014.07.28. 14:00 (72 hours)

My output:
2014.07.25. 14:00-22:00 (8 hours)  : Lisp compiler on the Lambda-Man CPU
2014.07.25. 22:00-00:30 (2.5 hours): Dumb Lambda-Man AI, utilities
2014.07.26. 09:00-13:30 (4.5 hours): Better Lambda-Man AI, Lightning round submission
2014.07.26. 14:00-17:30 (3.5 hours): Meta-assembler on the GHost CPU
2014.07.26. 17:30-19:30 (2 hours)  : Dumb Ghost AI, utilities
2014.07.26. 21:00-23:30 (2.5 hours): A bit smarter Ghost AI
2014.07.27. 07:30-10:00 (2.5 hours): Quite smart Ghost AI

first  day: 15.0/24 (63%)
second day: 10.5/24 (44%)
third  day: 00.0/24 (00%)

Conclusion:
Done more than a full day's worth of programming,
but I'm not motivated enough to continue.
A team of 2, maybe 3 members would have been ideal.
